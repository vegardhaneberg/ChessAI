# ChessAI
A Python Flask web application where you can play chess against a bot. The bot uses iterative deepening with minimax, move ordering and alpha beta pruning. 
The bot is available on the /game url.

To play the bot do the following:
	
	1. clone the repo
	
	2. run "flask run" form the root directory
	
	3. use the /game url

Can you beat the bot??
