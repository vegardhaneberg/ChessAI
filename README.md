# ChessAI
A Python Flask web application where you can play chess against a bot. The bot uses iterative deepening with minimax, move ordering, alpha beta pruning and a custom made heuristic function. 
The bot is available on the /js_game url.

To play the bot do the following:
	
	1. clone the repo
	
	2. run "flask run" from the root directory
	
	3. use the /js_game url

Can you beat the bot??

The chessboard is powered by chessboard.js and chess.js.
